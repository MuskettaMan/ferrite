# Ferrite Vulkan Renderer
This is a learning project to familiarize myself with the Vulkan graphics API. 

## Implemented features
[x] Vulkan initialization
[x] SDL3 window creation and input handling
[x] CMake build system
[x] Deferred rendering
[x] PBR materials
[x] IBL
[x] HDR
[x] Skydome
[x] GLTF model loading


## Learning goals 
I have several learning goals for this project:
1. The Vulkan SDK: I want to learn more about the Vulkan SDK and how to write graphics applications in modern API's.
2. Deploy on both Windows and my Steam Deck: My RTX 3080 pretty much allows me to do anything, I want to be more mindful of how I optimize.
3. Make use of CMake: Before I always used Visual Studio and MSBuild for my projects. I want to try something new, and this also coincides well with the cross-platform goal I set.
4. Deferred rendering: In previous projects I always made use of forward renderers and this limited me in terms of how I light my scene, I want to try out deferred rendering in this project.
